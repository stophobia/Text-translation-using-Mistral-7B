Mistral 7B has shown impressive performance on a number of text translation benchmarks. For example, on the WMT14 English-to-German translation task, Mistral 7B achieved a BLEU score of 30.4, which is better than the state-of-the-art at the time. Mistral 7B is also able to translate between a wide range of languages, including English, French, German, Spanish, Chinese, and Japanese.


This project is just a practice attempt at understanding how to implement the Mistral 7B model to translate text given by user from English to French.

Future scope of the project includes integrating the code with a frontend so users can interact with the model on a deployed website and the results can be more presentable and accessible.
